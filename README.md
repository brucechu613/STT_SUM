# STT_SUM
There are three parts of this code.
1. Environment setup, which are some packets you might need to install
2. imports, including some often tools you might use repeatedly therefore declared once
3. the actual python code

The second part and the third part are in the same python file.
Beware that for every link, three files are constructed, file.wav, file.mp3 and file.txt
